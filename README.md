# fairrad

fairrad is a small app targeted at iPads to choose from a list of possibilities with a wheel-of-fortune like interface. It's original intent was for teachers to pick kids for some task (say: "Tell a story about your weekend") in a fun, and random way. 

Development of the view itself is complete. More advanced tasks (manage groups, store data in cloud, create new wheels) are just sketched.

## Usage

Just open the XCode project. No external dependencies.

## State

The person I wrote this for is no longer a teacher so development is pretty much aborted. 
You might still want to salvage the wheel view itself - which should be easy: Just extract the `WheelView` and `SectorView` in `/ui/wheel`.

## License?
Nah. Do whatever.

Or, as we say in Legalese:
